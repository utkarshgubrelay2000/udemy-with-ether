This theme is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 

Next.js is a framework based on React, Webpack and Babel. It allows you to make blazing fast web applications with possibility of server side rendering.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## To generate production static site

```

then serve the **out** folder on a web host.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

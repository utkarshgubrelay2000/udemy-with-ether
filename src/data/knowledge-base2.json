Maybe you are reading this article to do so.<br/><br/><b>Time:</b> If you examine how you spend your time, it will be clear to you, you will know whether you procrastinate or not. Most people procrastinate more than they know. Keep a log of your daily activity, write a journal to keep track of how you spend your time, you will know how long you spend putting off tasks.<br/><br/><b>Why we procrastinate:</b> First thing you need to know is that it is a human condition.  95% of people admit to putting off work, according to Piers Steel, author of The Procrastination Equation.As for the phenomenon of putting stuff off, it’s “a purely visceral, emotional reaction to something we don’t want to do,” says Tim Pychyl, author of Solving the Procrastination Puzzle. The more averse you find a task, the more likely you are to procrastinate.<br/><br/><b>Sounds Familiar?</b> These are some of the characteristics that Pychyl discovered makes a task procrastination-worthy:<br/><br/><li>Boring</li><li>Frustrating</li><li>Difficult</li><li>Ambiguous</li><li>Unstructured</li><li>Not intrinsically rewarding (i.e., you don’t find the process fun)</li><li>Lacking in personal meaning</li><br/><br/>On a neurological level, procrastination is not the slightest bit logical — it’s the result of the emotional part of your brain, your limbic system, strong-arming the reasonable, rational part of your brain, your prefrontal cortex. The logical part of your brain surrenders the moment you choose Facebook over work, or decide to binge another episode of House of Cards when you get home.<br/><br/><b>Stopping Procrastination:</b> When you notice an approaching showdown between logic and emotion, resist the impulse to procrastinate.<br/><br/><b>More Ways to Stop it:</b> When you begin to notice the urge to procrastinate, do something to get started. Atimes, getting started is always the hardest, just do anything to start.<br/><br/><li>Think differently about tasks, make the idea of completing more fun and attractive.</li><li>Reward yourself for completing tasks, think about the reward.</li><li>Resist the urge to procrastinate.</li><li>Know what procrastinating could cost you.</li><li>Disconnect. Social media, family, friends. Within that period disconnect.</li><br/><br/><u><b>JOB</b></u><br/><br/><b>Job Openings</b><br/><br/><b>Front End Engineer</b><br/><br/>Amazon · New York, NY <b><a href='https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1396044/front-end-engineer'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Backend Engineer - Consumer</b><br/><br/>Spotify · New York, NY <b><a href='https://jobs.lever.co/spotify/e354812b-3591-42b2-8e8d-4849777472db/apply'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Full-Stack Software Engineer II</b><br/><br/>Microsoft · New York, NY <b><a href='https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/932937/Full-Stack-Software-Engineer?jobsource=linkedin&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_campaign=linkedin-feed'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Software Engineer (Leadership) - Infrastructure</b><br/><br/>Facebook · New York, NY <b><a href='https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/932937/Full-Stack-Software-Engineer?jobsource=linkedin&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_campaign=linkedin-feed'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><u><a href='https://www.workschool.co/jobs/'>See All Jobs</a></u><br/><br/><b><u>NEWS</u></b><br/><br/><b>What is going on?</b> Those hires will be coming from the following:<br/><br/><li>The Asia-Pacific region, where PwC plans to double its presence.</li><li>10,000 from its college mentorship program for Black and Latino students.</li><li>Candidates with experience in ESG (environmental, social, and governance) and artificial intelligence/machine learning.</li><br/><br/>PwC also plans to shake up some of its current workforce by combining its accounting and tax services divisions into a new unit called “trust solutions.” Following Big Four scandals involving tax shelters and sketchy auditing practices, the firm is looking to rebuild clients’ trust.<br/><br/><b>Bottom line:</b> PwC is betting that helping clients with their diversity and sustainability initiatives will be key to its competitiveness.<br/><br/><br/><b>BERNERS-LEE WORLD WIDE WEB SOURCE CODE TO BE AUCTIONED AS NFT</b><br/>Tim Berners-Lee, British computer scientist, will be auctioning the original code for the World Wide Web as a non-fungible token (NFT) at an online Sotheby’s auction.<br/><br/><b>What is going on?</b> Bids for the digitally signed Ethereum blockchain NFT will start at just $1,000 during the auction titled This Changed Everything and set to run from June 23 to June 30.<br/><br/><b>What are NFTs?</b> NFTs are digital files underpinned by blockchain technology – the same technology on which popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum rest.

Whoever wins, the real lesson here is that with enough money, you truly can do anything.<br/><br/>The news came today in the form of an announcement from Virgin Galactic stating that the launch window for its next test flight opens at 6 AM Pacific time on July 11, and that the mission will be the first to carry a full crew: two pilots, three specialists, and one billionaire. (Blue Origin had its own announcement.)<br/><br/><b>What is happening?</b> Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci will pilot the VSS Unity spacecraft; Chief Astronaut instructor Beth Moses will oversee the flight; Lead Operations Engineer Colin Bennett will monitor cabin equipment and procedures; Vice President of Government Affairs and Research Operations Sirisha Bandla will be handling a University of Florida microgravity experiment; and lastly, Sir Richard Branson “will evaluate the private astronaut experience.” In other words, he’s the first plain old passenger.<br/><br/>“I truly believe that space belongs to all of us,” the billionaire founder and private funder of the space tourism company said in the company’s press release. “After more than 16 years of research, engineering, and testing, Virgin Galactic stands at the vanguard of a new commercial space industry, which is set to open space to humankind and change the world for good. It’s one thing to have a dream of making space more accessible to all; it’s another for an incredible team to collectively turn that dream into reality. As part of a remarkable crew of mission specialists, I’m honoured to help validate the journey our future astronauts will undertake and ensure we deliver the unique customer experience people expect from Virgin.”<br/><br/><b>Big Picture:</b> The mission will, like others in the Virgin Galactic style, involve being flown by traditional means to what is normally considered a high altitude, after which the rocket-powered VSS Unity will detach from the plane and zoom up to above 80 kilometers, generally (though not universally) considered the edge of space. Branson will have gone through all the same training that future Virgin Galactic space tourists will go through, and will of course wear the same special blue suit.<br/><br/> If all goes according to plan, Branson will beat Bezos to space by a little more than a week, and probably win a long-running bet.<br/><br/> <u><b>COURSES</b></u><br/><br/><b>TOP 5 COURSES ON WORKSCHOOL THIS WEEK</b><br/><br/>Most people want to take courses to elevate their career, but they don't know where to start.

Transitioning to tech is made easy with WorkSchool.<br/><br/><b><u>NEWS</u></b><br/><br/><b>FACEBOOK LAUNCHES NEWSLETTER BULLETIN</b><br/><br/>This week, the social media giant, Facebook has unveiled its next new thing: Bulletin, a newsletter platform.<br/><br/>Bulletin is built on a separate platform from Facebook - on its website, the FAQ states that this is to “enable creators to grow their audience in ways that are not exclusively dependent on the Facebook platform.” You don't need a Facebook account on Facebook's infrastructure, including the use of Facebook Pay to purchase premium subscriptions and join subscribers-only groups and live audio-rooms.<br/><br/><b>The backstory:</b> In December, the FTC and a group of attorneys general from 48 states and territories hit Facebook with two lawsuits, alleging the company has a monopoly over personal social networking after its purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram.<br/><br/>Judge James Boasberg did not think the FTC provided sufficient evidence to back up that argument. “It is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist,” he said.<br/><br/>After the decision, Facebook shares gained 4.2% for its grand entrance into the four-comma dollar club. The first US company to hit a $1 trillion valuation was Apple in 2018, and since then Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all joined.<br/><br/><b>Looking ahead:</b> Facebook handpicked every writer on Bulletin to contribute. The initial slate of writers on Bulletin includes Malcom Gladwell, Mitch Albom, Erin Andrews and Tan France — the FAQ also notes that its beta program is U.S.-centric, with only two international writers at the moment (“We will look to include more international creators after our beta program launch,” Bulletin says.) Facebook is paying its writers up front for their contributions, and so far, doesn’t plan to take a cut of their profits. If writers choose to move off the platform, they will have the ability to take their subscriber lists with them.<br/><br/><b>WhatsApp Won’t Restrict Users Who Don’t Agree</b><br/><br/>Earlier this month, Facebook-owned WhatsApp said that users would lose functionality over time if they didn’t accept its new privacy policy by May 15th. In a reversal, Facebook now says that plan has changed, and users who don’t accept the updated policy actually won’t see limited functionality.<br/><br/>The rollout of the policy has been a confusing mess and raised concerns that WhatsApp would begin sharing more of users’ data with Facebook. Some WhatsApp user data, such as users’ phone numbers, is already shared with Facebook, a policy that went into place in 2016.<br/><br/><b>Insight:</b> WhatsApp has stressed this is not the case, though — the policy update is regarding messages sent to businesses via WhatsApp, which may be stored on Facebook’s servers.<br/>The initial deadline was set to February 8, 2021, but it received backlash from its global users, and dealing with the media scrutiny, Facebook extended the deadline to May 15, 2021.<br/><br/><b>Looking ahead:</b> The majority of users who have seen the new policy have accepted, the company says in a support article. This article also notes that you’ll get reminded about the new policy if you haven’t accepted it, and that’s still the case now. <br/><br/><u><b>JOB</b></u><br/><br/><b>Job Openings</b><br/><br/><b>Front End Engineer</b><br/><br/>Amazon · New York, NY <b><a href='https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1396044/front-end-engineer'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Backend Engineer - Consumer</b><br/><br/>Spotify · New York, NY <b><a href='https://jobs.lever.co/spotify/e354812b-3591-42b2-8e8d-4849777472db/apply'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Full-Stack Software Engineer II</b><br/><br/>Microsoft · New York, NY <b><a href='https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/932937/Full-Stack-Software-Engineer?jobsource=linkedin&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_campaign=linkedin-feed'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Software Engineer (Leadership) - Infrastructure</b><br/><br/>Facebook · New York, NY <b><a href='https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/932937/Full-Stack-Software-Engineer?jobsource=linkedin&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_campaign=linkedin-feed'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><u><a href='https://www.workschool.co/jobs/'>See All Jobs</a></u><br/><br/>  <br/><b><u>OPPORTUNITY</u></b><br/><br/><b>Rhodes Global Scholarships 2021 for Postgraduate Study at University of Oxford (Fully Funded)</b><br/><br/>Applications for Rhodes Scholarship are currently open.

Jeff Bezos is next.<br/><br/>As Elon Musk looked on, Richard Branson and five other Virgin Galactic crew members successfully completed a flight to space, a big milestone for the growing space tourism industry.<br/><br/>Branson and crew flew 53.5 miles in the air, unbuckled and floated around for a bit, and descended back to Earth before enjoying the more traditional Sunday morning activity of drowning yourself in champagne.<br/><br/><b>Backstory:</b> It was a dream come true for the 70 year old billionaire. Branson was hungover on the day the Apollo 11 astronauts landed on the moon in 1969. He had turned 19 two days earlier and had celebrated accordingly. But he was “gripped” as he watched Neil Armstrong on his family’s little black-and-white television, he later wrote in a memoir. He knew then—he was “instantly convinced”—that someday he would go to space himself.<br/><br/><b>Big picture:</b> Yesterday’s was the first mission that mimics the commercial flights Virgin Galactic hopes to launch soon. About 600 well-heeled customers who’ve paid at least $200,000 each are eagerly awaiting their opportunity to follow in Branson's footsteps.<br/><br/><b>What to expect:</b> Jeff Bezos will fly to space in a Blue Origin rocket in just a week. “Can't wait to join the club!” Bezos wrote in a congratulatory Instagram post after Branson's flight.<br/><br/><b><u>COURSES</u></b><br/><br/><b>TOP 5 COURSES ON WORKSCHOOL THIS WEEK</b><br/><br/>It is a new week, there are many interesting and exciting courses on WorkSchool this week.

Twitter’s VP of product said, “In the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped.”<br/><br/><b>Moral of the story:</b> Copying Snapchat’s ephemeral feature worked for Instagram, but platforms are learning that just because something clicks in one setting doesn’t mean it will work everywhere.<br/><br/><b>Bottom line:</b> Twitter hopes other new product releases, like its Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, will be less fleeting.<br/><br/><u><b>JOB</b></u><br/><br/><b>Job Openings</b><br/><br/><b>Front End Engineer</b><br/><br/>Amazon · New York, NY <b><a href='https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1396044/front-end-engineer'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Backend Engineer - Consumer</b><br/><br/>Spotify · New York, NY <b><a href='https://jobs.lever.co/spotify/e354812b-3591-42b2-8e8d-4849777472db/apply'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Full-Stack Software Engineer II</b><br/><br/>Microsoft · New York, NY <b><a href='https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/932937/Full-Stack-Software-Engineer?jobsource=linkedin&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_campaign=linkedin-feed'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><b>Software Engineer (Leadership) - Infrastructure</b><br/><br/>Facebook · New York, NY <b><a href='https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/932937/Full-Stack-Software-Engineer?jobsource=linkedin&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_campaign=linkedin-feed'><u>APPLY NOW</u></a></b><br/><br/><u><a href='https://www.workschool.co/jobs/'>See All Jobs</a></u><br/><br/><b><u>OPPORTUNITY</u></b><br/><br/><b>Commission Challenge 2021 – Space for Smart Mobility</b><br/><br/>Copernicus Masters invites you to apply for Commission Challenge- Space for Smart Mobility 2021!

On Tuesday, Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos blasted off into space on the New Shepard spacecraft. Last week, Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson rocketed into space on his own aircraft. Here are the differences between the two flights.<br/><br/>Bezos and three crewmates lifted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch site and rocketed to an altitude of more than 62 miles above the Earth.<br/><br/><b>By the numbers</b><br/>The suborbital space tourism market could be worth $8 billion by 2030, according to analysts at Canaccord Genuity. That would require over 1 million potential customers wealthy enough to afford the ticket and be interested in going to space.<br/><br/>After he landed yesterday, Bezos said sales for private seats on Blue Origin flights (two more of which are planned for this year) are already approaching $100 million. “The demand is very, very high,” Bezos said.<br/><br/><li>7,600 people participated in the auction for a seat on yesterday’s Blue Origin mission; the winning bid was $28 million, which “stunned” execs, according to the NYT.</li><br/>For now, space tourism companies are courting the Saint-Tropez crowd. Virgin Galactic, the company that launched founder Richard Branson to space earlier this month, promised that its astronauts would be outfitted in spaceflight suits tailored by Under Armour and served post-flight drinks, such as the “Beyond the Clouds Cocktail.”<br/><br/><b>Reality check:</b> While space tourism news has gotten the recent buzz, it’s just a small slice of the overall space market, which is currently dominated by SpaceX. In its big report on the space industry, Morgan Stanley identified the 10 drivers of a space economy that could grow to $1 trillion by 2040. Space tourism is just one of those drivers.<br/><br/><b>Bottom line:</b> More than anything else, these launches have been great marketing vehicles for the industry. Space-tech startups have raised $3.6 billion across 94 deals in the first six months of this year, and fundraising is on track to shatter last year’s record.<hr/><br/><b><u>EDUCATION</u></b><br/><br/><b>School Librarian: New Study Shows a 20 Percent Decline in the Last 10 Years</b><br/><br/>In spite of the high increase in the number of students who sort information through online mediums, the number of school librarians who could help them learn the fundamentals of research and media literacy have been quietly disappearing.<br/><br/>A report published on Monday from the <a href='https://libslide.org/publications/'><u>School Librarian Investigation: Decline or Evolution?</u></a> (SLIDE), a research project through Antioch University Seattle and funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, highlights an ongoing decline in the number of districts nationwide with school librarians.<br/><br/><b>What is happening?</b> According to the findings, there were about 20 percent fewer librarians during the 2018-2019 school year in the 13,000 districts examined than a decade prior. But the absence of these educators isn’t equally distributed; Smaller, rural districts, and those with higher proportions of English-language learners, Hispanic students, and low-income students were more likely to lack a librarian.<br/><br/>“What we knew from our work since 2018 is that we've been losing school librarians at a pretty alarming rate for a decade,” says Keith Curry Lance, a library statistics and research associate with the RSL Research Group, and co-author of the study. “But everybody’s not losing their school librarians, just the people who can least afford to lose them.”<br/><br/><b>Backstory:</b> The dropping rate of districts with librarians isn’t a recent change. In fact, the steepest declines happened in the early 2010s, although a downward trend has been consistent throughout the decade. As of 2018-2019, about three in ten school districts lacked even a single librarian.<br/><br/>That trend contrasts with changes to other education professions over the same period. Instructional coordinators and district and school administrators increased significantly over the past ten years and teachers decreased slightly. None experienced the sustained year-after-year losses that school librarians did.<br/><br/><b>What to know:</b> Districts with higher levels of students living in poverty, English language learners, and Hispanic students were significantly less likely to have librarians on staff. In fact, majority Hispanic districts were more than twice as likely to have no librarians. Majority non-white districts generally were also less likely to employ a librarian, although the correlation wasn’t as dramatic.<br/><br/>Notably, the researchers found that financial resources were not correlated to librarian staffing. They examined various levels of per-pupil spending among districts and found that those that spent the least actually had better staffing than some that spent more.<br/><br/>“The explanation you get nine times out of ten when you ask ‘Why did you cut your librarians?’ is ‘We just couldn't afford it. We hated to do it but we just didn't have enough money,’” says Lance. “Well, that doesn't line up with the per-pupil spending data.”<br/><br/>The study authors also found that nine out of ten charter districts, which can sometimes include a single school, had no librarians as of the 2018-2019 school year.<br/><br/>One important determining factor for districts is legislation mandating some level of school librarian staffing. Although these policies are not always enforced, having laws on the books still correlates with having a school librarian in at least one school in the district. States that had more university programs that train K-12 teachers in library media and grant them endorsements are also more likely to hire them across their districts, but those programs are on the decline.<br/><br/>“This is the chicken-or-the-egg situation. As the universities don't produce [librarians], school districts are saying, ‘I can't find people so we won't have the school librarian,’” says Debra E. Kachel, affiliate faculty at Antioch University Seattle and the study’s other co-author.<br/><br/><b>Bottom line:</b> The new research does, however, provide important context for understanding the landscape immediately before the latest economic downturn. And looking ahead, the effects of these losses will compound over time, says Kachel. She found that only a small fraction of districts without a librarian a few years ago reinstated any of those educators.<br/><br/>“There are a lot of school administrators now who have been in districts where there have been no school librarians ever,” she says. “Why would an administrator want to add a position when he or she has never experienced working with that type of professional?”<hr/><br/><b><u>COURSES</u></b><br/><br/><b>TOP 5 COURSES ON WORKSCHOOL THIS WEEK</b><br/><br/>It is a new week, there are many interesting and exciting courses on WorkSchool this week.

I could not be more excited for what's to come,” Butterfield added.<br/><br/><b>Backstory:</b> In December, Salesforce signed a definitive agreement to acquire the popular messaging software platform Slack Technologies in a cash and stock deal worth $27.7 billion, making it Salesforce's largest-ever acquisition. Last week, the Department of Justice told the company it closed its antitrust investigation of the deal, giving the green light for the transaction's close.<br/><br/>As companies debate the future of work post-COVID, Salesforce said companies learned last year that “if you don't have a digital way to connect with your employees, customers, and partners, you don't have much of a chance of surviving.”<br/><br/>“Headquarters are no longer on Madison Avenue or Main Street—they are in the cloud. Every business—in every industry—has to optimize for a digital-first customer, employee, and partner experience,” the company said in its announcement.<br/><br/><b>Way to go:</b> Shares of Salesforce were last trading up 0.14%, or 34 cents, near $240.45 in the pre-market.
